## Sentiment Analysis of Film Reviews [Recurrent Neural Network using Python, TensorFlow & Keras]

Recommender Systems are used to predict items that a user will select among many choices. Recommender systems are used in a variety of areas, with commonly recognised examples taking the form of playlist generators for video and music services, product recommenders for online stores, or content recommenders for social media platforms and open web content recommenders.  

**Movie Predictions:** I used a movide data set from IMDB, which is an embedded Keras dataset.  I trained an RNN to classify if a written movie review was positive or negative. 

**The Magic:** I am using an Recurrent Neural Network, which will be trained how to "read" movie reviews and guess whether the author liked the movie or not. And this was completed by creating a sentiment classification from the first 80 words of a movie review.<br>

**Recurrent Nueral Networks:** RNN's are very powerful tools for wide variety of problems, used for sequences of data, including languages (which are sequences of words).  As it turns out, **Deep Learning** is especially suitable to predicting sequences of events, like which videos you're likely to watch next.  So this has applications and recommender systems that deal with situations where the order of events matters.
